The purpose of this application is to build a database using the language 
of Python in unison with MySql for creating, reading, updating, and 
deleting (CRUD Operations) information for a fictional school. The database 
will be comprised of four data tables relating to the clients for the school, 
actual courses the school provides, participants in the courses, and 
information for available teachers the school has. 
A relational database will be used to help structure
and organize the different branches of information to be 
categorized and Python will be used for efficiency in building the
database with all information.

Pycharm Integrated Development Environment 3.11.2 (Latest Version Available)
MySql Command Line 8 (Or latest Verson)
